Tactile Editor is an application that allows users to create vibration patterns for motors.
"Motor objects" represent the basic unit of these patterns and include parameters for physical motor assignment, start time, duration, and intensity.
These objects can be assigned to different tracks to allow different vibrations to be layered together.
Patterns can be tested by playing them back on a connected device.
Sensor values input to the Editor can be used to trigger the start of different patterns.
