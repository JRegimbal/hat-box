This authoring tool allows for the design of video-synchronized tactile effects to be rendered using the actuators along the fingers and palm of the tactile glove.
Frames of the video are shown in the GUI and it is possible to draw tactile lines across them that will be mapped to the array on the glove.
These tactile frames are greyscale with color intensity mapped to vibration intensity.
Previews of the surrounding video content are shown to aid in planning and synchronizing the effects to the existing audio-visual media.
