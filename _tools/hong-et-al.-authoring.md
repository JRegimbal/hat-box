This authoring tool supports the creation of vibration patterns through finger tapping on a touch screen.
Duration of a touch is mapped to the duration of a vibration while touch area is mapped to intensity.
Touch area is expected to be proportional to pressure.
A visualization of the vibrotactile pattern is previewed to users during use, but this pattern must be transferred to a separate computer to drive an attached actuator.

For more information, consult the [TEI'13 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/2460625.2460660).
