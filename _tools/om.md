The OM Editor is an app to control OM Wearables: sleeves on the forearm each with three ERMs.
The user can create sequences of up to six vibration patterns of the same duration where they can select the intensity of vibration and which actuators will vibrate.
These sequences can be annotated and stored.

For more information on the OM Editor or Wearables, please consult the [MobileHCI'21 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3447526.3472028).
