Hapticlabs Studio is a no-code application to design, protoype and develop haptic feedback pattern.

A visual editor allows you to arrange, adjust and orchestrate your signals. You can create variations and tune them to your specific needs. The Hapticlabs AI assistant allows you to generate haptic tracks from scratch and tailor them to your application. Hapticlabs studio offers you various ways to build interactive demos and connect to different output devices, ranging from smartphones to your own custom hardware.
