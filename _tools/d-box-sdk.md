The D-BOX LiveMotion SDK is used to create motion effects on a D-BOX chair in response to events, such as those in a simulation or game.
Telemetry information concerning the user's avatar, vehicles, or surrounding environment must be sent when updates occur.
These data are used by a custom-built D-BOX Motion System to create haptic effects with limited latency between events occurring in the virtual environment and a response being felt.

For more information, consult the [D-BOX website](https://www.d-box.com/).
