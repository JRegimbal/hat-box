HapticLib is a small library for deploying haptic patterns on embedded devices. It is able to control multiple actuators at a time and provides an abstraction over low-level hardware control.

For more information about HapticLib, consult the [2013 Symposium on Applied Perception paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/2492494.2501882) or the [project website](https://hapticlib.guardati.it/).
