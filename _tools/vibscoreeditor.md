VibScoreEditor applies uses music notation as a metaphor for vibrotactile editing.
In this system, a "vibrotactile clef" determines the frequency and waveform assigned to each "pitch" occupying a position on the staff.
Notes have a pitch by virtue of this position, an intensity indicated by a number inside the note head, and a duration set by the shape of the note.
Two dynamics, crescendo and decrescendo, allow for gradual increasing and decreasing of note intensity respectively.
By switching between different clefs and arranging a series of vibrotactile notes, rests, and dynamic markings, users can create complex time-varying vibration patterns.
