SeeingHaptics allows users to attach haptic feedback of various types to different virtual objects.
These interactions are represented in the VR environment using different visual icons.
"Haptic listeners" can be attached to other devices, such as VR controllers, so that people in the virtual environment can experience the appropriate effect when they are near an object with an associated haptic effect.
No output devices are supported out of the box, and SeeingHaptics is intended to aid in planning a VR haptic experience.
