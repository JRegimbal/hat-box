The Hapticon Editor is intended to create haptic icons for 1 DoF force-feedback devices by directly recording a user's motions on the device and by combining waveforms.
While recording only allows for mapping motion over time, waveforms can be used as functions of force over position and time.
Common waveforms, such as sine waves, can be automatically generated, but custom ones can be created by manipulating their constituent keyframes.
