GENESIS is a physical modelling system that uses the [CORDIS-ANIMA](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3680567) framework to create virtual musical instruments.
By creating networks of different modules in a one-dimensional space and adjusting their parameters, simulations can be constructed and interacted with via a connected haptic device.
Sounds produced by the model are played back.
While earlier versions of GENESIS required non-realtime simulation of instruments, multiple simulation engines are now supported, including those that run in real time (e.g., [GENESIS-RT](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12976-1_22)).

Information on GENESIS is included in numerous places, including the [1995 International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) paper](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/bbp2372.1995.155/1), the [2002 ICMC paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00481717), the [2009 ICMC paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4642), and the [2013 International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12976-1_22).
