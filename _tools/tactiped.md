Users of TactiPEd would first create a template file specifying the hardware device they are using and its layout of actuators.
This layout will then be preserved in the main editor interface, where sequences of vibrotactile patterns can be created and assigned to different actuators.
A playback mode allows for users to quickly feel the changes made to amplitude, frequency, and timing in the tool.
